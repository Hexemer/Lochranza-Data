This repository contains raw data, reduced datasets, annotated R code, and QGIS files used to analyse biodiversity on the north and south slopes of Lochranza, Isle of Arran (Scotland). Multiple taxonomic groups were surveyed, including plants, freshwater invertebrates, ground invertebrates, birds, bats, moths, and mammals. Data were collected to compare species richness and abundance between slopes and to identify invasive or protected species relevant to proposed management plans. The dataset consists of quantitative species counts gathered through visual surveys (supported by apps such as Seek and ObsIdentify), kick sampling, sweep netting, pitfall traps, incidental sightings, acoustic recordings from AudioMoths, and camera trap imagery.

This repository is organised into several sub-directories.

raw_data/ contains the original field datasets (CSVs and XLSXs).

reduced_data/ contains cleaned or summarised datasets used in analysis.

code/ includes the annotated R scripts used for data cleaning and analysis.

qgis/ holds spatial layers and site maps exported from QGIS.

figures/ contains final figures and plots used in this report.

FAIR Data Principles

Findable: The data are findable through this public GitHub repository, as referenced in the appendix.

Accessible: All data are provided in open, widely used formats that can be viewed using free software, ensuring full accessibility.
Interoperable: Datasets follow standardised naming conventions aligned with Darwin Core where appropriate and include a README file describing each dataset. All R scripts are fully annotated to support understanding and reuse.

Reusable: Methods are transparently documented in the accompanying R code. The combination of raw and processed data, metadata, and script annotation ensures that the dataset can be readily reused in future analyses.
